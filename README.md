# Wireless Logic - Software Engineering Technical Test

## Introduction

First of all, thank you for giving me this opportunity - I had a lot of fun trying to overengineer this project. It took
me about 6 hours from start to finish, but I believe that under the time pressure the exact same functionality (without
the fancy glitter all-over the code) would be achievable in under an hour, including the tests.

Enjoy the code review! ðŸ‘‹

## System requirements

The app is based on NodeJS with TypeScript and Yarn as a package manager.

* NodeJS v16
* Yarn v1.22

## How to test the app

The tests are written with Jest test framework. You can find them inside the `__tests__` directory.

### Install dependencies

* `yarn install` or `yarn`

### Run the tests

* `yarn test` or `jest`

## How to run the app

### Install dependencies

* `yarn install` or `yarn`

### Build source code

* `yarn build` or `tsc`

### Run the app

* `yarn start` or `node dist/main/js`

## Summary

Thanks to overengineering we are able to easily swap components and test every single one independently.
